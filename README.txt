A CLONE OF CHATGPT CREATED VIA CHATGPT
Entirely Python-less and NodeJS-less
No back-end, no database, no dependencies, no yarn nor npm... just pure Vanilla JS.

IMPORTANT: 
Open the JS file and look for :

headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': 'Bearer yourapikeyhere'
            },

replace 'yourapikeyhere' with your personal OpenAI api key

You are ready to go.
